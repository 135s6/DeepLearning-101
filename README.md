# Deep Learning-101
These Jupyter notebooks are prepared as coding practices
for an introductory course for Deep Learning.

To run the notebooks, use either a virtual environment (local desktop) or Google Colab environment.

## From a local desktop
1. Setup a python virtual environment and activate it.
2. From a terminal, type:

   `>jupyter lab`
3. Once the browser launches, run all cells of 00-setup.ipynb.
   This will install all necessary libraries needed for the notebooks.


## References
The materials are created based on various sources. Here is a short list.
* [MIT Deep Learning](https://github.com/aamini/introtodeeplearning/):
One of the best introductory lectures on Deep Learning.
 The lectures are easy to understand and covers extremely broad topics
  including reinforcement learning which is strictly not a part of Deep Learning.

* [모두를 위한 딥러닝](https://github.com/hunkim/DeepLearningZeroToAll):
In my opinion, this is the best introduction course for Deep Learning available online in Korean.
  Professor Kim explains difficult machine learning concepts in down-to-earth
  easy-to-understand words. My only complaint is that the lab portions tend to be verbose
  and written in TensorFlow v1 which is quite different from TF v2.
  If interested, [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/migrate) is how to migrate v1 to v2.  

* [TensorFlow tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials):
Of course, the official TensorFlow serves as the best authority for TensorFlow.
  The tutorials are fairly easy to follow and setup and there are many available examples.
